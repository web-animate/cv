        <p><em>Whiteboard Animator for <a href="http://web-animate.com">Web Animate</a><strong></strong></strong></em></p>
        <p>Having spent 25 years in the healthcare industry in both the UK and South Africa, I decided to have a dramatic career change. I dug out my old HGV license which I hadn't used in 25 years to give me a stable income. However, to add an
          income stream, I self taught whiteboard animation skills. I have a degree of web development skills which are also self taught. Therefore, to fill in the huge gaps in my skills I am currently re-training as a full stack web developer.

I count myself very fortunate to associate with him cause we are determined and will see to the implementation of this project for the welfare of all South Africans. I will always appreciate and cherish the support his family gave him to let him come over to SA for few months when the late Deputy Health Minister Dr Sefularo was implementing in the project. I am sure with his wealth of experience and partnership with various health companies we'll achieve our goal and South Africa will join Britain, USA and other countries in the Safe Handling of Patients</td>

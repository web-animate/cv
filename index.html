        <p><em>Whiteboard Animator for <a href="http://web-animate.com">Web Animate</a><strong></strong></strong></em></p>
        <p>Having spent 25 years in the healthcare industry in both the UK and South Africa, I decided to have a dramatic career change. I dug out my old HGV license and I also re-trained as a full stack web developer and whiteboard animator. I love
          art but cannot draw to save my life. So, I
          get the computer to do it for me. I get so much pleasure from seeing ideas develop and present as creations akin to art. </p>

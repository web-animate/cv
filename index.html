        <p><em>Whiteboard Animator for <a href="http://web-animate.com">Web Animate</a><strong></strong></strong></em></p>
        <p>Having spent 25 years in the healthcare industry in both the UK and South Africa, I decided to have a dramatic career change. I dug out my old HGV license which I hadn't used in 25 years to give me a stable income. However, to add an income stream, I self taught whiteboard animation skills. I have a degree of web development skills which are also self taught. Therefore, to fill in the huge gaps in my skills I am currently re-training as a full stack web developer.
